1)On one bectutiful Sunday Selvan went to Aaron's house for exam preparation
They have decided to study Mathematics subject because they have exams by coming Monday, Aaran is a master in Mathematics but Selvan is not as good in Mathematics so James trained with Selvan for getting a high score In the exam
After teaching some problems to Selvan. Aaron have given some tasks to Solvan to solvo
The problem is to convert input float into a double. Can you help Selvan in finding the solution

3)Professor JD has lots of options. Bottles containing all types of potions are stacked on shalves which cover the entire wall from floor to cailing.
Professor JD has broken his bones several times while climbing the top shelf for retrieving a potion. He decided to get a ladder for him.
But he has no time to visit Charu. So he instructed Bargav to make a ladder for him. Professor ID specifically wants a step ladder that looks like an inverted "V' from a side view
Professor just mentioned two things before vanishing
B-separation between lelt side (LS) und right side (RS) on the ground
15-the length of left side
What should be the length of RS3 At one extreme 15 can be vertical and as other RS can be vertical
Problem
Bargov is angry and confused.
Can you help him find the minimum and maximum length of RS.

Input Format:
Only line of input contains2 integers roprosenting IB and US respectively.
Output Format:
The only line of output contains minimum value of RS and maximum value of RS, separated by space.
The orower (RS) will be considered correct if it has relative and obsolute error less them 10-2
